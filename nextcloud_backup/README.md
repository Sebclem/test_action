## NextCloud config

First, you need to configure all your Nextcloud information.

To do this:
1. Open the add-on Web UI
1. Open NextCloud config menu (Top right gear, and Nexcloud)
1. If your NextCloud instance uses `HTTPS`, enable the `SSL` lever
1. Enter the `hostname` of the NextCloud instance. You can specify a custom port by adding `:[port]` at the end of the hostname (`exemple.com:8080`)
1. Now enter the Nextcloud username that you would like this add-on to use.
1. For password, we highly recommend using an `App Password`.

    >To generate a `App Password`, go into your personal setting into Nextcloud, Security page. You can generate one via the `Devices & sessions` section. Simply enter a name and hit `Create new app password`.
