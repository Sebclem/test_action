## About

Easily backup your Hass.io snapshots to Nextcloud.

> __Info:__<br>
> Auto Clean is executed after every upload and every day at 00h30

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Nextcloud Backup" add-on.
1. Start the "Nextcloud Backup" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Nextcloud Backup" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the web UI for the "Nextcloud Backup" to configure the add-on.


**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/Sebclem/sebclem-hassio-addon-repository`.


## NextCloud config

Firts, you need to configure all your Nextcloud information.

To do this:
1. Open the add-on Web UI
1. Open NextCloud config menu (Top right gear, and Nexcloud)
1. If your NextCloud instance use `HTTPS`, enable the `SSL` lever
1. Enter the `hostname` of the NextCloud instance. You can specify a custom port by adding `:[port]` at the end of the hostname (`exemple.com:8080`)
1. Now enter the Username that you when this add-on use.
1. For password, we highly recommend to use `App Password`.<br>
    >To generate a `App Password`, go into your personal setting into Nextcloud, Security page. You can generate one via the `Devices & sessions` section. Simply entre a name and hit `Create new app password`

## Hass.io Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "ssl": false,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL on the Log Viewer. Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

**Note**: _The SSL settings only apply to direct access and has no effect
on the Hass.io Ingress service._

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io._

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io._

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the add-on by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_
